    "Life expectancy is strongly correlated to schooling, income composition of resources, and BMI. This makes sense as people with more schooling may know the proper channels for receiving care, people with more income will be able to afford care, and people with higher BMIs are more likely to have more income to spend on food and health services. Thinness from ages 1-19 are not good indicaters of BMI, as children tend to be smaller, and there is a smaller window in terms of BMI score (for example, An adult might be of proper weight\n",
    "from 160 to 200 while a child may be of appropriate weight from 60 to 80.)"
