'''
First, load the dataset from the weatherinszeged table from Thinkful's database.
DONE
Build a regression model where the target variable is temperature. As explanatory
variables, use humidity, windspeed, windbearing, and pressure. Estimate the model
using OLS.
Now, check if your model meets the Gauss-Markov Conditions above. If some of the
assumptions are not met, discuss the implications of the violations for the correctness
of your model.

'''
Question 1: .287 is not a good number but a satisfactory metric. since they
are both the same it shows that the R-squared metric is not biased

Question 2: The R-squared and R^2 adjusted are higher, so this model improves
upon the last

Question3: The R-squared and adjusted are only slightly better so
visibility must not be that impactful of a value

Question 4: for vis and humwind, AIC and BIC are 3.2e+5. for just humwind,
the value is the same. with no humwind, the value is slightly higher. The best
was visibility and humwind
