Statistical models
tossing a coing, can you formulate a model for it?

We would toss a coin, and determine our probability of heads coming up is .5 and our
probability of tails coming up is .5

A statistical model is a simplified, mathematical representation of the data
scientist's best guess about the underlying processes that created the data

- when creating a model, we prioritize dens features, or features which have the most
impact on variance

Statistical models are mathematical models

Assignment#


1. A coin toss is 1/2 heads, 1/2 tails probabilities. The features include the shape of
the coin, the markings on both sides of the coin (for aerodynamics).

2. The features include - member movie choices both watched and unwatched,
similarity as a percentage with other users, time of viewing, how long users watch content

Different title cards can be introduced, and title card selecction can be incorporated
into the model.

Audio data from users who have audio assistants can be included into models

The number of queries made by a user can indicate a lack in catalogue depth for a particular
kind of user

subtitles chosen for different users
